This is an online event management system software project that serves the functionality of an event manager. The system allows only registered users to login and new users are allowed to resister on the application. This is proposed to be a web application. The project provides most of the basic functionality required for an event. It allows the user to select from a list of event types. Once the user enters an event type (Marriage, Dance Show, Birthday as well as meeting ), The system then allows the user to select the date and time of event, place and the event descriptionâ€™s. This data is then sent to the administrator (website owner) and they may interact with the client as per his requirements and his contact data stored in the database
